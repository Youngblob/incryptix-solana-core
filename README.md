# About

InCryptix enables institutions to use the power of decentralization to issue automated credentials such as degrees, badges, and certificates. It uses Solana blockchain technology and NFTs to make them non-fungible and trustlessly verifiable for its users.

# The problems we're solving

1 - Issuing Certificates: Most institutions issue their certificates in a way that has a central point of trust, which is prone to hacking, spoofing, and imitation by malicious individuals

2 - Storing Certificates: Physical certificates are ancient! and easy to imitate! Using a decentralized blockchain to issue certificates make them non-fungible and tamper-proof.

3 - Validating Certificates: Validating a credential may require contacting the issuing authority directly, that use their own centralized method of verification, thus making the process challenging and time-consuming

# The solutions we've come up with

1 - Issuing Certificates: A certificate is deployed on the Solana blockchain as an open, publicly verifiable program. This non fungible certificate acts as an automated process of evaluation and verification of the certificate.

2 - Storing Certificates: As a user continues their learning journey, their progress is recorded on their program's storage on the Solana blockchain.

3 - Validating Certificates: Certificate verification would be as easy as entering a certificate ID and a digital signature to validate and prove ownership of the certification.

# Usage

This repository exposes an API that exposes the functionality to register a certificate. This is available at ```./app.py```. The solana program is created on runtime and deployed to the devnet.
